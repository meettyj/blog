# Introduction

Hey, guys. Thanks for coming. I used writing in some popular China blog site like CSDN and Iteye. The coming summer holiday really set me free from the burden of school work, so I decided to do somethinig cool and the first thing I want to do is to build my personal blog.

This blog will be used to record some skills, learning and thoughts. If you have any suggestions, be free to contact me. I'd like to hear your words. Please enjoy it :)
